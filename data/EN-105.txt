Umrah

Umrah is one of the best deeds and acts
which draw you closer to Allah. When performing Umrah, the pilgrim turns toward
the House of Allah with his heart, tongue,
limbs, and seeks His mercy and pleasure.


In this guide, you will find the most important information, instructions, and
advice you need to know during your
Umrah trip.


The Virtues
of Umrah

Here are some of the many virtues of
Umrah:
¨ It cleanses sins and removes poverty
and need. The Prophet (m) said: “Perform Hajj and Umrah consecutively;
for they remove poverty and sin as
the bellows removes impurity from
iron.”


¨ Repeating Umrah expiates the sins
committed between them. The Prophet (m) said: “From one Umrah to the
next is an expiation for what was
committed between them.”


Umrah
in a Nutshell

Umrah is an act of worshipping Allah by entering the state of Ihraam, performing Tawaf
around the Ka’ba, Sa’i between Safaa and Marwa, and shaving or trimming your hair.


1
A Muslim enters into the state of Ihraam
from the place specified for him by Islamic
law, and he abstains from the prohibitions
which he is prohibited from while in Ihraam.

He recites the Talbiyah, saying:
Labbayk-Allaahumma labbayk, labbayka
laa shareeka laka labbayk. Innal hamda
wan-ni’matah laka wal-mulk, laa shareeka lak.
“At Your service, Allah, at Your service. At
Your service, You have no partner, at Your
service. Truly all praise, favour and sovereignty is Yours. You have no partner.”

For more information concerning the Ihraam, download the Ihraam guide

Click here



He goes to the Haram, performs Tawaf around
the Ka’ba seven times, with the Ka’ba his left.
He begins at the Black Stone and ends at the
Black Stone.

He prays two rak’aas after completion.

He heads to Safa, and from here he heads
towards Marwa. If he reaches Marwa, he has
completed one circuit. Then he returns to
Safa to complete the second circuit, and so
on, until he completes seven circuits, ending in Marwa.


Men shave or trim their hair, and women
gather their hair and cut from its ends as
much as a fingertip (1-2 cm).

Thus, the Umrah is complete
and Ihraam ends.


Umrah for People
Performing Hajj
At-Tamattu

Tamattu’ refers to a person who wishes to
perform Hajj and first enters into the state
of Ihraam to perform his Umrah. Then, after
completing his Umrah, he leaves the state of
Ihraam, only to re-enter the state of Ihraam
on the eighth of Dhul-Hijjah. In this way, he
has completely separated his Umrah from
his Hajj.


How to Perform
At-Tamttu

¨ One takes on the state of Ihraam for Umrah in the Hajj-months (Shawwal, DhulQi’dah and Dhul-Hijjah).

¨ When he reaches Makkah, he performs
Tawaf and Sa’i for his Umrah, shaves or
trims his hair, and then leaves his Ihraam.

¨ On the day of Tarwiyah (the 8th of Dhul-

Hijjah), he re-enters the state of Ihraam
for Hajj and performs all its actions.

Important Tips

Before Arriving
at the Grand Mosque

The pilgrim should not go to the Grand
Mosque until after coordinating with the
official of the group he came with, in order to know the exact time for performing Umrah. It is also important to clearly
know the location of his residence, and
to save the address on his mobile phone
or on a piece of paper.



If you are coming to the Grand Mosque
via buses: Remember the bus stop and
be sure of the meeting point after completing your Umrah.

28

When you arrive at the squares around
the Grand Mosque you will find panels
in front of the gates showing those coming from far away whether the gate is
suitable for entry or exit.

29

Escalators

You will usually need to use the escalators
to go up or down in the Grand Mosque
and its squares and services, so here are
the most important warnings when using the escalators:

30

1
Do not sit on the escalator, even if you are
tired.

Stand firmly on the escalator and hold onto
the moving belt.

Women should be careful that their hijabs
and jilbabs do not get stuck at the end of
the escalator.

Walk immediately after reaching the end of
the escalator so that people do not collide
into you from behind.

31

32

Do not take wheelchairs onto the escalator,
unless you do so with the help of a competent person.

If you have an elderly person or a person
who is not accustomed to taking the escalator, be by his side and hold him to protect
him from falling.

Do not push or harm pilgrims if there is
crowding when going up or down, and give
all pilgrims an opportunity to get on.

Do not place your foot on the side brush at
the bottom of the escalator, as this may injure you and disrupt the cleaning system of
the escalator.

33

Tawaf

Tawaf is an act of worship to Allah in
which the Muslim performs Tawaf around
the Ka’ba, worshipping Allah and drawing
close to Him according to what He has prescribed.

34

The beginning and end of Tawaf:
¨ The pilgrim performing Hajj or Umrah
begins his Tawaf from the corner where
the Black Stone is. There is a green sign
indicating this on the upper floors.
¨ The pilgrim performing Hajj or Umrah
should perform Takbeer (saying “Allaahu Akbar”) in each round when he
passes the Black Stone, the pilgrim is
not required to perform Takbeer exactly at this point. one can perform Takbir somewhere near this point. So if
the pilgrim finds himself past the Black
Stone, he can still perform Takbeer.

35

¨ The pilgrim performs Takbeer and
points with his hand facing the Black
Stone, then begins his Tawaf with the
Ka’ba to his left (counterclockwise).
Kissing the Black Stone is a Sunnah for
those who are able to do so, but this is
difficult during the seasons of worship
and crowded days.

36

¨ The pilgrim continues performing
Tawaf, supplicating Allah and praying humbly to Him.
¨ When the pilgrim reaches the
corner which precedes the Black
Stone, called the Yemeni corner,
it is desirable for him to touch it if
possible, but this will be difficult
during the Hajj season.
¨ Then he ends his circuit at the
corner of the Black Stone, which
is the place from which he started.
Here, he points with his hand and
performs Takbeer, and with this he
has completed one circuit.
¨ He repeats this until he completes
7 circuits.

37

General tips while performing Tawaf:
¨ Stopping inside the area
of Tawaf causes crowding
and pushing.

¨ Do not go in the opposite
direction of Tawaf, whatever the reasons.

¨ Avoid crowded areas.

¨ Be sure to wear a face
mask, and apply precautionary measures.

Special wheelchairs for Tawaf
are available for the elderly and
those who need them. You can
find more details about this by

38

Sunnahs of Tawaf

Al-Ithtiba:
This is a special way of wearing the Ihram for
men, by which he brings out his right shoulder, following the example of the Prophet
Muhammad (m).

39

Ar-Ramal:
Ramal is fast walking with small footsteps
(not jogging) during the first three circuits of
Tawaf if possible (without harming the people around you). Then, the remaining four
circuits are completed in a normal walking
pace.

Supplication:
Increase your supplications and invocations
to Allah for what matters to you and preoccupies your heart. It is Sunnah to say at
the last part of Tawaf between the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone “Rabbanaa
aatinaa fid-dunyaa hassanatan wa fil aakhirati hassanah, waqinaa ‘adhaab-an-naar”
(“Our Lord, give us goodness in this world
and goodness in the Hereafter and protect
us from the punishment of the Fire”).

40

The Two Rak’aas
of Tawaf

If the pilgrim performing Hajj or Umrah has completed the seven circuits, he
should cover his shoulder. Then, it is Sunnah for him to pray two swift Rak’aas behind Maqaam Ibraahim according to the
place designated by the responsible authorities, or he may pray them anywhere
in the Grand Mosque. Allah the Almighty
said: “And take ye the station of Abraham
as a place of prayer.” [Surah Al-Baqarah,
Ayah 125].

41

The right place to perform the two Rak’aas
of Tawaf:
¨ The pilgrim can pray them anywhere
in the Grand Mosque, according to the
instructions of the security men at that
specific time.
¨ But if it is easy for him to pray so that
Maqaam of Ibraahim is in front of
him, even from a far place, then this is
desirable, because Allah the Almighty
says:“And take ye the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.”

42

¨ Beware of irritating the people performing Tawaf or disrupting them, for
the person performing Tawaf has priority and more right to be there. Allah mentioned them first in His Book
when He said: “Purify My House for
those who perform Tawaf and those
who are staying [there] for worship
and those who bow and prostrate [in
prayer].”

It is Sunnah to recite Surah Al-Kaafiroon in the first rak’aa and Surah
Al-Ikhlaas in the second.

43

¨ The Messenger of Allah (m) drank from
Zamzam after he finished his Tawaf, and
it is Sunnah to do as he did. This is very
easy nowadays while on your way to perform Sa’i and inside the place of Sa’i, as
Zamzam water dispensers are spread
throughout the Grand Mosque.

44

Sa’i: How to Reach
the Place of Sa’i

¨ When you finish your Tawaf, you
will find panels which guide you to
the place of Sa’i and point towards
Safa, where Sa’i starts.

45

We advise you, after completing your Tawaf,
to head to the place of Sa’i on the upper
floors:
¨ In order to avoid crowding on the ground
floor.
¨ In order to make things easier for yourself and your Muslim brothers.

46

To reach the upper floors of the place for
Sa’i:
Head to the designated escalator entrances
(you can ask the security guards to show you
the way).

47

Safa and Marwa

Safa and Marwa are two small mountains
on which Hagar (Mother of Ismail), peace be
upon him, climbed in search of food or water.
Safa:
¨ A small hill from which Sa’i begins.
¨ The rocks of the hill are still visible on the
ground floor.

48

Marwa:
¨ A small hill where Sa’i ends.
¨ Sa’i ends here.

Sa’i between Safa and Marwa is one of
the rituals of Hajj and Umrah:
Allah the Almighty said:“Behold! Safa
and Marwa are among the Symbols of
God.”

49

Description
of Sa’i

The pilgrim worships his Lord by walking the distance between Safa and
Marwa 7 times, as his Noble Messenger (m) did.

50

One starts his Sa’i in Safa and ends it
in Marwa.

¨ Walking the distance from Safa to
Marwa is considered one circuit.
¨ From Marwa to Safa is considered
the second circuit, etc.

51

The two green signs:
It is recommended for men who are able,
to run between the two green signs, as
did the Messenger of Allah (m) .

52

Supplication at the
Place of Sa’i

Supplication at the place of Sa’i:
The pilgrim should fill the entire time of
Sa’i with remembering and supplicating
Allah or with reciting the Qur’an.

53

Supplication at the beginning of Safa and
Marwa:
When the pilgrim arrives at the beginning of
Safa or Marwa, it is Sunnah for him to raise
his hands towards the Qiblah at the beginning of each circuit and supplicate to Allah
and say “Allaahu akbar” before starting a
new circuit.

The supplication of Allah’s Messenger
(m) :
When the Messenger of Allah (m) first
reached Safa after Tawaf, he would recite
the Words of Allah the Almighty:“Behold!
Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols
of God.” Then he would say:“I begin with
that which Allah began with.” (meaning
Safa before Marwa).

54

55

When climbing up Safa and Marwa, the
Prophet (m) used to face the Qiblah and say:
“Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar,
laa ilaaha il-Allaah, wahdahu, laa shareeka
lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul-hamdu wa huwa
‘aala kulli shay’in qadeer. Laa ilaaha il-Allaahu wahdahu. Anjaza wa’dahu, wa nasara ‘abdahu, wa hazamal-ahzaaba wahdahu.
Allah is the greatest; Allah is the greatest; Allah
is the greatest. There is no deity except Allah,
alone without a partner. To Him belongs the
Dominion, and to Him belongs all praise. He
gives life and death and He has power over everything. There is no deity except Allah alone.
He fulfilled His promise, supported His slave
and defeated the confederates alone.
After that he supplicates with whatever he
wishes, and then repeats this a total of three
times.

The person performing Sa’i should not stop
to pray in a place which disrupts movement
and causes crowding, and he must adhere to
the instructions of security personnel in the
Grand Mosque.

56

Sa’i Statistics

71

Tips for a Safe
Haircut

When at the barber, make sure of the
following:
¨ That he uses disposable razors with
plastic handles.
¨ That he changes the shaving tools
and brings out new ones after finishing with the previous pilgrim.
¨ That he washes his hands with soap
and water before he starts shaving.

72

Repeating Your
Umrah

It is recommended to travel again to perform
Umrah from time to time, for those who are
able. As the Prophet (m) said: From one ‘Umrah to the next is an expiation for what was
committed between them.”

73

74

But repeating the Umrah in the same trip was
something not known among the Companions,
except for a reason. After performing their Umrah, they used to perform a lot of acts of worship,
such as reciting the Qur’an and praying.
However, if it brings ease to the pilgrim, it is permissible to repeat Umrah on the same trip, for
oneself or for others, if that does not cause hardship for other pilgrims.

Whoever wishes to perform Umrah must
obtain permission from the official applications and perform Umrah at the time specified for him.

75

Whoever wishes to perform Umrah and issues the official permit, must leave the
boundaries of the Haram to enter the state
of Ihraam from there. He can, for example, go to the mosque of ‘Aishah - may Allah be pleased with her - in Al-Tan’im and
enter Ihraam from there.

To reach the mosque of ‘Aishah, may Allah
be pleased with her

76

Being satisfied with performing only one
Umrah during the busy seasons helps reduce stampedes and leaves an opportunity for other pilgrims who were unable to
perform Umrah to perform their Umrah in
peace and tranquility.

77

Health Tips

To regulate body temperature, avoid fatigue and compensate for the loss of fluids:
We recommend drinking large amounts of
Zamzam water, bottled water, and juices.

78

To protect your feet when walking on tiles:
¨ Take a break when you feel tired.
¨ Avoid walking barefoot for a long time.
¨ Do not walk barefoot on the tiles of the
outer squares.

79

How do I protect myself from skin abrasions?
¨ Clean and shower before Umrah.
¨ Use ointments between your thighs
(available at pharmacies).
¨ Apply anti-fungal powder.

80

Performing
Umrah in Ramadan

Umrah has great virtues at all times. It is one
of those deeds which expiate sins, as the
Prophet (m) informed us. But during Ramadan, Umrah has a special virtue.

82

The Prophet (m) said: “...For an Umrah
in Ramadan equals Hajj (in reward).”

83
