Pelting the Jamarat is one of the great rituals
of Hajj that the Messenger of Allah () did and
commanded us to do.
In this guide, we will explain the information
you need to know about the Jamarat on your
trip.


What is Pelting
The Jamarat?
Pelting the Jamarat is one of the great
rituals of Hajj that the Messenger of Allah
() did and commanded us to do.

This is done by throwing a specific number of small pebbles at the place specified by the Messenger of Allah () in Mina,
which is called the Jamarat.

The Jamarat is not a specific wall or the
pole towards which pebbles are thrown,
rather the name of the area in which pilgrims should aim their throw.


The Three Jamarat
There are three Jamarat which are
pelted. They are:

1

The Small Jamrah: This one is also
referred to as the first Jamrah. It is the
first Jamrah after Al-Khayf mosque in
Mina when heading towards Makkah.


The Middle Jamrah: This is the second
Jamrah, after the small Jamrah and before
Jamarat Al-Aqaba.


Jamarat Al-Aqaba: also referred to as the
big Jamrah it is located at the end of Mina
when heading towards Makkah.

The Story
of the Jamarat

When Allah commanded His Prophet Ibraahim to slaughter his son Ismaa’il, he responded to the command of Allah and went to implement this command, but Shaytaan objected
to him at the site of the small Jamrah, and
whispered to him not to slaughter his son.
Ibraahim threw seven pebbles at him, and
he disappeared and vanished. Ibraahim went
away, only to be intercepted by Shaytaan, at
the middle Jamrah, so he threw seven pebbles
at him again, and Shaytaan disappeared
and vanished. Finally, Shaytaan intercepted
Ibraahim () a third time, at Jamarat Al-Aqaba,
and once again he pelted him seven times and
Shaytaan disappeared.


Ibraahim () proceeded to carry out the
command and so he placed his son on his
forehead to slaughter him. It was then that
Allah called him saying: “We called out to him,
“ O Abraham ! Thou hast already fulfilled
The vision !”—thus indeed Do We reward
Those who do right. For this was obviously
A trial—.” In other words: ‘You have complied
and submitted to the command of Allah and
succeeded in this trial and test.’


Why Do We Pelt
the Jamarat?

1

We follow the example of the Prophet ()
and follow his command. He threw pebbles
at the Jamarat and said: “Take your Hajj rituals from me.”

By doing so, we submit to Allah, His commands, and His laws. Hajj is a great form of
worship which is filled with complete submission to Allah and His laws in all its entirety.


We remember the story of Allah’s prophet
Ibraahim, peace be upon him.

We anger Shaytaan with it, declaring that we
are following the path of the Prophets in their
enmity for him, for he gets angry when he sees
people pelting the place where Ibraahim ()
opposed him.



We remember Allah and glorify Him with
our tongues and our hearts. The Prophet ()
said: “Going round the House (the Ka’bah),
running between as-Safa and lapidation of
the pillars are meant for the remembrance
of Allah”.
This is why, with each pebble thrown, the
pilgrim should say “Allaahu Akbar” (Allah
is Greatest), as if declaring that Allah’s
glorification and love is greater than all
whims and temptations.



How Do I Pelt
the Jamarat?

1
Go out to throw with your group and at the specific time which was allocated to your group in
order to avoid crowding, getting lost, and harassing other pilgrims.


How Do I Pelt
the Jamarat?

The Jamrah is pelted with seven separate
pebbles, one pebble for each throw.


How Do I Pelt
the Jamarat?

Declare the greatness of Allah with every throw
by saying “Allaahu Akbar” (Allah is Greatest).


How Do I Pelt
the Jamarat?

Be sure to stay away from crowds and try to
approach the Jamrah from the least crowded side.


How Do I Pelt
the Jamarat?

Direct your throw at the wall in front of
you in the middle of the Jamrah so that the
pebble falls into the basin located around
the Jamrah.


How Do I Pelt
the Jamarat?

Be careful not to hurt anyone with what
you throw.



Pelting Jamarat
Al-Aqaba on the
Day of Eid

Jamarat Al-Aqaba

Jamarat Al-Aqaba is the farthest Jamrah
when you come to pelt. It is located at the
end of Mina, towards Makkah, and it is the
only Jamrah which a pilgrim pelts on the day
of Eid.
The pilgrim must pelt
Jamarat Al-Aqaba on the
day of Eid, the 10th of
Dhul-Hijjah, or the night
thereof, after leaving
Muzdalifah.


The pilgrim throws
seven pebbles, saying
takbeer (Allaahu Akbar)
with each one.
The pilgrim stops reciting the Talbiyah after
pelting Jamarat Al-Aqabah.

Continue walking after pelting the Jamrah
and do not stop so as not to disrupt the
movement of pilgrims and to leave an
opportunity for others.


When to Pelt
Jamarat Al-Aqaba

The time for pelting Jamarat Al-Aqaba begins at midnight for those who hurry and leave
Muzdalifah at night, and the time for pelting
continues throughout the day of Eid. It is better not to delay the pelting until dawn on the
eleventh day, for those who are able.

The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) left Muzdalifah between dawn and sunrise, and reached
the Jamrah at the time of Duha (forenoon) .


Pelting the Jamarat During

the Days of Tashreeq

Pilgrims pelt the Jamarat on
the three days of Tashreeq;
11th, 12th, and 13th of DhulHijjah for those who delay, and
11th and 12th th for those who
hasten.
Pelting the Jamarat is the most important ritual for pilgrims during these days, as they continue to remember Allah and perform Takbeer.


28

How Do I Pelt the Jamarat

During the Days of
Tashreeq?

The pilgrim should go out with his own
group at the time specified for them and in
the specified manner, whether it is by train or
by walking to the Jamarat.

The pilgrim takes the Jamarat road and follows the
directions and instructions
he receives.

29

The Small Jamrah

The pilgrim begins with the Small Jamrah,
which is the first one he will find, and throws
seven pebbles at it, reciting Takbeer with each
throw.
Then moves away from
the Jamrah, away from the
crowds, and withdraws from
the road so as not to affect
the path of the pilgrims. He
turns towards the Qiblah,
raises his hands in supplication, and prays for what he
wants mercy, forgiveness,
reconciliation, and acceptance of his Hajj.

30

The Middle Jamrah

After that, he walks to the middle (second)
Jamrah and pelts it, just as he did with the one
before it, with seven pebbles, reciting Takbeer
with each throw.
Then he turns away from it, heading to Jamarat Al-Aqaba, withdraws from the road, supplicates to Allah and asks for whatever he wills.

31

Jamarat Al-Aqaba

Finally, he sets out for Jamarat Al-Aqaba
(the big one), which is the third of the Jamarat, and he pelts it as he did with the one
before it, with seven pebbles. But it is not prescribed for him to supplicate after pelting this
Jamrah .

The pilgrims should not stop after they
have finished stoning the Jamarat, so as
not to disrupt the pilgrims’ movement and
their departure.

32

Do not harm pilgrims by
throwing trash in their way.
Make use of the designated areas
instead.
When going to the Jamarat, adhere to the
specific rules of crowd control which are
clearly defined, as they have been designed
for your benefit and in service of the guests of
Allah.

33

The Right Time for
Pelting the Jamarat

All days of Tashreeq are considered the right
time for pelting, until sunset on the 13th of
Dhul-Hijjah.
Rest assured that all the times officially
scheduled for pelting are in accordance with
the opinions of reputable jurists and legal
scholars.

The pilgrim must abide by the allotted time
for his group to pelt, in coordination with the
competent authorities.

34

Appointing
a Representative
to Pelt on Your Behalf

The
kingdom
provided
many
services throughout the ritual sites
and especially at the Jamarat. The
arrangement of pelting the Jamarat
has become smooth, safe and easy,
enabling pilgrims to pelt the Jamarat
and perform their rituals safely and
smoothly.

35

It is permissible for the elderly, the weak,
the sick, pregnant women, and anyone who
fears harm to himself by pelting, to assign
someone from among the pilgrims to pelt the
Jamarat on his behalf.
The representative who will perform the
pelting shall pelt the Jamrah on his own
behalf first, then on behalf of whomever he
represents. Then move to the next Jamrah and
do the same, and so on until the final Jamrah.

36

37

A Description of
the Thrown Pebbles

A description of the thrown pebbles:
They should be small pebbles.
Smaller than hazelnuts, close to the size of
peas or date pits.
Approximately 1cm in length. One should
not use large pebbles.

38

Do not waste too much time choosing
the shape of the pebbles and their size.

After collecting the stones in his hand, the
Prophet () said: “Throw something like
these.’ Then he said: ‘O people, beware of
exaggeration in religious matters for those
who came before you were doomed because
of exaggeration in religious matters.”

39

Picking Up Pebbles
for Pelting

It is prescribed for the pilgrim to pick up
7 pebbles before leaving Muzdalifah, which
he will throw at Jamarat Al-Aqabah on
the day of Eid. But if he collects them in
Mina or any other place, then this is also
permissible.
It is not preferred to pick up pebbles for
the rest of the days from Muzdalifah, so as
not to burden the pilgrim, in addition to the
fact that this is not prescribed. Pebbles for
the rest of the days should be picked up in
Mina or from anywhere else on the way.

40

To make it easier for pilgrims, many
groups nowadays provide pebbles, and
there is nothing wrong with using them.

Be careful not to pick up pebbles in walking areas so as not to endanger yourself
and others.

41

The Jamarat
Then and Now
In the past, pelting the Jamarat was
fraught with difficulties due to the large

crowds and the stampedes of pilgrims at
specific points, in which a number of deaths
occurred every year.

42

Based on their duty to serve pilgrims and
ensure their safety, the Kingdom decided to
study the matter in all its aspects. A radical
solution to the problem was designed and
implemented in order to end the suffering
of pilgrims and achieve the legitimate
requirements with clarity and smoothness.

How Do I Get
to the Jamarat?

Ways to reach the Jamarat vary according to
the group, its time and location. Pilgrims must
adhere to the method of regulation and crowd
control used for their group.

1) Almashaaer Metro Line: Some pilgrims
arrive at the Jamarat via Almashaaer Metro
Line, after which the pilgrims travel on foot
to reach the place of pelting.

48

2) Pedestrians: Those who reach the Jamarat
on foot, it is preferable for them to carry a
parasol to protect them from direct sunlight
if their pelting takes place during the day.
Pilgrims should ensure they wear comfortable
shoes which are suited for long walks.

3) Buses: Other pilgrims may choose to arrive
to the Jamarat by buses which are suited for
larger groups.

49

4) Open-top cars (golf carts) are available
to transport the elderly and those who
are not able to walk when ascending the
Jamarat Bridge.

5) Be sure to take your medicines, such as
inhalers for asthma and allergies, for those
who suffer from these illnesses, as you may
need them due to fatigue, long walking and
dust inhalation.

50

Strictly adhere to the directives of the security officers and the rules for crowd control, as
they are only in place for the benefit, safety,
and comfort of pilgrims. Be sure not to disobey these directives and rules, as this will lead
to overcrowding, bottlenecks, and will causeharm to the guests of Allah.

There are emergency teams scattered all
around the Jamarat, and you can call them
if you experience any health issues, God
forbid.

After you have finished Pelting the Jamarat
you will find many services, such as restrooms,
barbers, and restaurants.

51

Shaving After Pelting
Jamarat Al-Aqaba

After the pilgrim pelts Jamarat Al-Aqaba, it is
prescribed for him to shave or trim his hair, which
is one of the duties of Hajj.

A large number of certified barber shops and
stalls are available after pelting the Jamarat.
