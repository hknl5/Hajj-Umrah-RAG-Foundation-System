Madinah

Madinah was the abode where the Prophet
Muhammad (m) migrated to and resided,
and the place where his grave and his honorable body are.
It is the second holiest city for Muslims after Makkah.
It was also the first capital of Islam, and the
nucleus of Islamic civilization whose light
spread throughout the world.


In this guide, you will find the most important information and directions for a
unique visit to the Prophets Mosque.


Madinah’s Virtue
and Position

The Prophet’s city is the second holiest spot
in Islam, and Allah has singled it out with
many virtues, including:


It is the home of Islam and guidance.
The Prophet’s city was and will remain the
home of Islam and guidance; it goes out
from it and to it it will return. And from
it, it will grow and multiply, as the Prophet (m) said:
Faith will shrink back to Medina as a snake
shrinks back to its hole.



It is blessed:
Blessing means the abundance and
growth of goodness, and the Messenger
of Allah (m) supplicated for Madinah to
be blessed in its food, sustenance, and
all its affairs, when he said:
“O Allah, bless us in our fruits; bless us
in our city; bless us in our saa‘ and bless
us in our mudd. O Allah, Ibraahim (Abraham) was Thy servant, friend and prophet, and I am Thy servant and prophet. He
made supplication to Thee on behalf of
Makkah, and I make on behalf of Madinah the same supplication as he made on
behalf of Makkah, and as much again.”


It is a sanctuary:
A sanctuary in which (the reward for)
good deeds are multiplied, and bad
deeds are magnified. Harming its people is considered one of the greatest
sins in the sight of Allah.


The Different
Names of Madinah

The city of the Prophet has several
names which carry great meanings
Of these names are the following:
Madinah (the city): Every city is ascribed to what follows it (like: the
city of London, the city of Amsterdam, etc), except for the city of Allah’s Messenger, as it is THE city defined by itself.


It is then described as An-Nabawiyyah
(prophetic), referring to the Prophet
Muhammad (m).
It is described as Munawwarah (enlightened) because of the light of the
Chosen One, who illuminated it with
guidance and the religion of Islam after the migration.


Daar-ul-Hijrah (the abode of Hijrah):
Because it was the land which had
the honour to welcome the Messenger of Allah and his companions and
had the honour to come to their aid
and defend them.
Taybah:
Which is derived from “At-Tayyib”,
meaning something which is good,
nice, beautiful, pure, and graceful.
This is because of the purity of its
soil, the goodness of its inhabitants,
and the good quality of life in it.


The Prophet’s Mosque
The second greatest mosque in Islam after the Grand Mosque (in Makkah) is the Prophets Mosque. It was
built by the Messenger of Allah (m)
and his companions after their migration to Madinah. It was a center
of knowledge and civilization, where
the Qur’an was recited and the companions gathered with our Noble
Messenger (m), benefiting from his
blessing and guidance.


Multiplication
of Prayers

The reward for a prayer performed in
the Prophet’s Mosque is multiplied, as
the Prophet (m) said: “And a prayer
performed in this mosque of mine is
equal to a thousand prayers in any
other mosque, except for the Grand
Mosque (in Makkah).”


Travelling to Visit
the Mosque

It is desirable for a Muslim, if he is
able, to travel to pray in the Prophets Mosque, as the prophet (m) said:
“Animals are saddled only for prayer
in the three mosques: the Grand
Mosque, the Aqsa mosque, and this
mosque of mine.”


Muslims have successively built and taken care of it, following their Noble Messenger (m).
It was expanded more than once by the
Kings of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
After the expansions carried out by the
Saudi state in the mosque on all different
floors, its prayer area is now bigger than
500,000 square metres (5,382,000 sq.ft.)

It accommodates up to

1.000.000
worshippers at peak times.

The Old
Mosque

As-Sarhaat
(the Courtyards)


The Old Mosque:
This is the mosque in which the Messenger of Allah (m) and his companions
prayed. Its historical shape and ancient
inscriptions have been preserved.


As-Sarhaat (the Courtyards):
Two roofless areas behind the old mosque.
In the past, they were furnished with
pebbles, and for this reason the Sarhah
is called: Al-Haswah (the place covered
with pebbles). Nowadays, there are sunshades which open automatically during
the day to protect worshipers from the
sun, and they close at night to ventilate
the mosque.


The expansions:
These are the other buildings of the
mosque, surrounding the Sarhaat.


The open squares:
These are large areas prepared for worshipers, covered with sunshades which open and
close automatically to protect worshipers
from the sun, and also contain ventilation
and mist sprayers to cool the air for worshipers.

Al-Hujrah Ash-Shareefah

(The Honorable Room)

The name (Honorable Room) is given
to the house of the Prophet (m) in
which he was staying with the mother
of the believers, ‘Aishah bint Abi Bakr
Al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with
her and her father. Allah Almighty honored ‘Aishah by placing in her room
the tomb of the Prophet (m) and his
two companions, Abu Bakr as-Siddiq
and Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be
pleased with them both.


This Honorable Room is located to the
southeast of the Prophet’s Mosque,
and its door opens directly to the Honorable Rawdhah.
For this reason, the Prophet (m) may
have offered his head to ‘Aishah, may
Allah be pleased with her, so that she
could comb his hair while he was in seclusion in the mosque.


28

When the Messenger of Allah (m) fell
ill, he passed away in ‘Aishah’s room,
after he had asked permission from
the mothers of the believers to be
nursed in ‘Aishah’s room, may Allah
be pleased with her, and they gave
him permission.

29

After the Prophet (m) died, he was buried where he died, because he said: “Every prophet is buried where he dies.” So
he (m) was buried in this room .
Then his two companions, Abu Bakr
As-Siddiq and Umar bin Al-Khattab,
were buried there after him.

30

The room remained outside the
mosque but then became a part of
it after the subsequent expansions
which took place in the mosque.
Muslims took great care to protect the Honorable Room from rain,
floods, and the enemies of Islam,
with a building and walls which preserve the Honorable Room for its occupant (m) and which preserve the
commandment of the Messenger of
Allah that his grave should not be
taken as a place of celebration or a
place for polytheism and worship of
other than Allah.

31

Above the room today, we find a
distinctive green dome marking
the room. It was painted green in
1253H.

32

Giving Greetings (Salaam)

to the Prophet ()

It is recommended for anyone who is
in Madinah to visit the grave of the
Prophet (m) and greet him.

33

Description of Visiting
the Grave of the Prophet ()

1

One enters through the Salaam Gate at
the front of the Prophet’s Mosque, to
the east, and walks with serenity and
dignity.

34


When one reaches the Prophet’s room, the
place of his honorable grave, he greets the
Noble Messenger (m) and says: “As-salaamu ‘alayka yaa Rasool-Allah, wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuhu” (Peace be
upon you, O Messenger of Allah, and Allah’s mercy and blessings).Then he offers
prayers upon the Prophet (m) (by saying: “Allaahumma salli ‘aala Muhammad,
etc). And one may add, for example:
As-salaamu ‘alayka yaa Nabiyy Allah,
As-salaamu ‘alayka yaa kheeratullaah
min khalqihi, as-salaamu ‘alayka yaa
Sayyid-al-Mursaleena wa imaam-al-muttaqeena. Ash-hadu annaka qad balaghta ar-risaalatah wa addaytal-amaanah,
wa nasahtal-ummah, wa jaahadta fillaahi haqqa jihaadihi. Allaahumma salli
‘aala Muhammad wa ‘aala aali Muhammad kamaa sallayta ‘aala Ibraaheema wa
‘aala aali Ibraaheema, innaka hameedun
majeed. Wa baarik ‘aala Muhammad wa
‘aala aali Muhammad, kamaa baarakta
‘aala Ibraaheema wa ‘aala aali Ibraaheema, innaka hameedun majeed.
Which means:
Peace be upon you, O Prophet of Allah,
peace be upon you, O beloved of Allah,

35

peace be upon you, O Master of the Messengers and leader of the pious. I bear
witness that you have delivered the message, fulfilled the trust, advised the Ummah, and strived for the sake of Allah in
the best way possible. Oh Allah, praise
Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as you praised Ibraaheem (Abraham) and the family of Ibraaheem, indeed, You are praiseworthy and glorious.
And bless Muhammad and the family of
Muhammad as you blessed Ibraaheem
and the family of Ibraaheem, verily, You
are praiseworthy and glorious.

36


Then he should take a step and greet
Abu Bakr As-Siddiq.


Then he should take a step and greet
‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattab.

37

38


One must stand with respect and good
manners, and not raise his voice.
The Prophet (m) is revered, both alive
and dead.
Allah the Almighty said:“O ye who believe ! Raise not your voices Above the
voice of the Prophet, Nor speak aloud
to him In talk, as ye may Speak aloud
to one another, Lest your deeds become Vain and ye perceive not. Those
that lower their voice In the presence
of God’s Apostle,—their hearts Has
God tested for piety : For them is Forgiveness And a great Reward.”

39


When greeting him, one should stand
as close to him as possible, facing the
grave.


When greeting, one should only stand
for a short while, to also give other visitors the opportunity to greet, and so
as not to cause crowding and noise.

40


One should not wipe the grave or anything around it.


One should not ask the Prophet (m) to
fulfil his needs, relieve him of trouble,
or heal a sick person, because all of this
is only asked from Allah Almighty, the
Living who does not die. The Prophet
(m) came with Tawheed (monotheism) and rejected shirk (polytheism).


After this, he should leave just
as he entered; with serenity and dignity, to make room
for those who are behind him
who have also come to greet
our Noble Messenger (m).

41

The Honorable
Rawdhah

The Honorable Rawdhah is part of
the Prophet’s Mosque. It is located at
the front of the mosque, and extends
from the house of the Messenger of
Allah (m) (the Honorable Room) to
his pulpit.

42

The Rawdhah is a place of high rank,
with a great impact on the soul, in
which mercy and blessings descend.
This is where the Messenger of Allah (m) and his companions used to
pray, supplicate, and remember Allah in all their conditions.
It is the best part of the Prophet’s
Mosque.
The Prophet (m) said: “What is between my house and my pulpit is one
of the gardens of Paradise.”

43

How Is the Rawdhah One of
the Gardens of Paradise?

This place is similar to the Gardens of
Paradise in the attainment of happiness and tranquility for those who sit
in it.
Worship and prayers conducted in this
place lead to the garden of Paradise.

44

How Do I Pray in the
Honorable Rawdhah?

In view of the large number of people
who are eager to pray in the Honorable
Rawdhah, and to reduce crowding, whoever wants to visit the Rawdhah should
book through the official app, in which
times and places of entry are determined.

45

Instructions for Entering
the Prophet’s Mosque

Most gates are wheelchair accessible.

Wheelchairs are available for the elderly and those who need them next
to the main gates inside the mosque.

46

When you enter the
mosque, you can put your
shoes at the gate in the
designated places, or in
the boxes which can be
found everywhere inside
the mosque.
Remember the box number and do not forget it,
because there are similar
boxes all around.

It is courteous to others to ensure
you place your shoes in the designated areas rather than in the way
of other pilgrims.

47

Usually there are places to
break your fast on Mondays and Thursdays inside
the Prophet’s Mosque.

48

All water available for drinking
in the Prophet’s Mosque is from
the well of Zamzam.

And is transported to the Prophet’s
Mosque with the highest standards of
safety and hygiene.

49

Always remember that this is a place
where the Messenger of Allah (m) and
his honorable companions walked, worshipped, and remembered Allah in all
their conditions. Also remember that his
honourable grave is near you, so fill your
time with what benefits you, and beware
of raising your voice and laughing. Be
careful not to be distracted by your mobile phone.

50

There are study circles inside the
Prophet’s Mosque; pilgrims can join
them and learn the recitation and
memorisation of the Qur’an amongst
other things, taught by specialized
teachers.

51

In case you drop anything on the carpets or marble of the mosque which
causes it to become dirty, request the
help of a cleaner to remove it.

52

The corridors inside the mosque are
designated for walking and moving, so
performing your prayers in them will
obstruct free passage and will cause
crowding.

53

In the mosque’s external squares, there
are places to perform ablution (Wudhu), to save the worshiper the hassle
of going to external toilets.

54

Beware of slipping in the square, and wear
shoes that are slip resistant.

Smoking is prohibited in the squares of the
Sanctuary.

55

Be careful not to stand further to the
front than the Imam during prayer in
the southern square of the mosque.
You can know the directions for aligning with the Imam, so as not to stand
in front of him, through the signs in the
square.

56

All the gates of the mosque are numbered with clear numbers next to each
gate, so you can reach the gate you
want by learning the gate number.

57

The gates of the squares of the Prophet’s Mosque are also numbered and
are written on the gates of the outer
wall of the squares. They are different
from the numbers on the gates of the
Prophet’s Mosque.

58

In case you need a health check, there
are two health centers in the squares
of the Sanctuary.

59

Walking barefoot in the squares
If you lose your shoes or need to search
for them in the squares in the heat, try to
walk on the white marble only because it
is cool.
Beware of walking barefoot on black or
coloured marble, because this can be extremely hot and can lead to injuries.
