most important information about the
Grand Mosque.


The Status
and Virtues of
Makkah

Makkah is the best of all lands and the
dearest of all lands to Allah and to His
Messenger, peace be upon him. Allah
has chosen it as the place to perform the
rituals of Hajj and considers the journey
to it for this purpose an act of worship
by which degrees are raised and sins are
erased.
The Prophet, peace be upon him, said,
addressing Makkah, “I swear by God
that you are the best part of God’s earth
and the part dearest to Him.”


It is the first house of worship ever built
on earth for people to worship Allah and
declare His unity: “The first House (of worship) appointed for men was that at Bakka
full of blessing and of guidance for all kinds
of beings”: (3:96)

In this guide, you are going to learn everything you need to know about the Grand
Mosque to achieve the goals for which you
have undertaken this journey.


What Is the Haram?
and Why Is It so
Important?

It is the place where it is forbidden to
do certain things that are not forbidden
elsewhere. Avoiding such things in this
place testifies to one’s veneration of Allah who has declared such things forbidden in it:
“Such (is the Pilgrimage) : Whoever honours the sacred Rites of God, for him It is
good in the sight Of his Lord.” (22:30)


Allah has chosen and exalted this land and
made it a sanctuary, in which He has forbidden what He has made permissible in other
places and conferred on it manifold virtues
and benefits that are not found elsewhere.


Its sanctity and lofty status are deeply
rooted in the history of the entire universe.
Indeed, Allah chose this land and made it
sacred on the day He created this universe
and it will continue to be as such until the
end of time.
The Prophet, peace be upon him, said:
“Allah made this land sacred the day He
created the Heavens and the Earth, so it
is sacred by the Decree of Allah until the
day of Resurrection.”


What Does the
Haram Mean to Me?

You are now in a place on which Allah
conferred a lofty status, honour and virtue before He created humans, and commanded Abraham, peace be upon him,
to raise the foundations of the Ka’ba and
build its walls upon them to be the prayer
direction (qiblah) and provide guidance to
all mankind:
“ The first House (of worship) appointed
for men was that at Bakka full of blessing
and of guidance for all kinds of beings:”
(3:96)


You are in a place where the reward
for one good deed is multiplied many
times over, and the sin incurred for one
bad deed is not like that committed
anywhere else.


Allah commanded his noblest servants,
Abraham and Ishmael, peace be upon
them, and after them His Messenger, Muhammad, peace be upon him, to purify it,
maintain it and take good care of it.


The Boundaries
of Haram

The Haram has well-known boundaries which Allah taught Abraham, peace
be upon him. Knowledge of these boundaries had been passed down from one
generation to another and was ultimately clarified by the Messenger of Allah,
peace be upon him.
They can be seen today on the roads
leading to Makkah.


Their distances from the Ka’ba differ from one place to another:

From Madinah Road
(At-Tan’eem) :

6.5 km
From Jeddah Expressway:

22 km

From the new Al-Laith Road:

17 km

From Taif (As-Sail) Road:

12.850 km

From Taif (Al Hada) Road:

15.5 km

The Haram area holds a very special position in Islam because there are rulings
related to it for those who enter it. We
are going to learn about some of these
rulings in this guide.


What Are the
Distinguishing
Characteristics of
the Haram?

There are a number of rules and virtues that pertain solely to Makkah and
its Haram, to the exclusion of all other
places on earth, these virtues include
the following:


1

The reward for one single prayer in
the Haram including all mosques and
houses in Makkah that are within it—
is equivalent to one hundred thousand prayers anywhere else.


Non-Muslims are not allowed to enter
it.


It is forbidden to engage in any form
of hunting in it.


It is forbidden to cut down its trees
or grass.


Any person who enters it is safe with
regard to his life and property and
thus must not be killed or wronged in
any way. The Almighty says, “Whoever enters it is safe.” (3:97)


During the Hajj season, entry to Makkah
is efficiently organized and anyone without a Hajj permit is not allowed to enter so that pilgrims may be served in the
best possible manner.


The Ka’ba

The Ka’ba is the direction which Muslims
face in their prayers (qiblah) and to which
their hearts incline. It is only around it that
they perform Tawaf as an act of worship to
Allah the Almighty.



The Ka’ba has four corners that are named after the directions they face:
¨ The Yemeni Corner to the south
¨ The Black Stone to the east
¨ The Syrian Corner to the west
¨ The Iraqi Corner to the north



Al-Hateem (Hijr Ismaa’eel):
This is a semi-circular open space next
to the Ka’ba, part of which used to be
of the Ka’ba.


The Door of the Ka’ba:
¨ It is located on the eastern side of it.
¨ Its length is 318 cm and its width is
171 cm.
¨ It is made of pure gold and weighs 280
kilograms.


28

Al-Multazam:
This is the eastern wall or part of it
between the Black Stone and the door
of the Ka’ba.
Iltizaam refers to the act of placing one’s
chest, face, arms and palms on this wall
and supplicating to Allah for whatever
one wishes.
Doing so may be difficult or impossible
during the Hajj season and in overcrowded conditions.

29

Al-Meezaab (The Roof Drain):
This is the part that is attached to the
roof of the Ka’ba to channel water from
the roof, which then falls onto Hijr Ismaa’eel.

30

31

Ash-Shaadharwaan (The Riser):
This is a structure that supports the Ka’ba
and surrounds it from three sides. It was
initially erected to strengthen the Ka’ba and
protect it from torrential rain. It has been
preserved over the years and is covered today with white marble.

32

The Black Stone

¨ The Black Stone is one of the stones of
Paradise, as the Prophet, peace be upon
him, once mentioned.
¨ It is the start and finish point of each
circuit that pilgrims perform around the
Ka’ba.
¨ The Prophet, peace be upon him, deposited it in its proper place following a dispute that broke out between people as
to who should have the honour of raising
it to its place after part of the Ka’ba was
damaged by heavy rain.

33

The Location of the Black Stone:
¨ It is located in the southeastern corner of the Ka’ba.
¨ It rises 1.5 m from the ground.

34

The Silver Frame:
¨ The Black Stone is encased in a silver frame that serves to protect it.
¨ The first to join the parts of Black
Stone with silver was ‘Abdullaah ibn
Az-Zubayr, may Allah be pleased with
him.

35

Touching and Kissing the Black Stone:
¨ A pilgrim should touch and kiss the Black
Stone after each circuit, as this was the
practice of the Prophet, peace be upon
him, only if possible during the off-seasons when there is no overcrowding.
¨ A pilgrim should perform takbeer (say,
‘Allaahu akbar’) when touching it or waving at it from afar in case of overcrowding.

36

A Muslim must avoid jostling and
crowding to kiss the Black Stone, as
this may cause harm to himself and
others.

37

Maqaam Ibraaheem
(Abraham’s Station)

Maqaam Ibraaheem:
Is the stone on which Abraham, peace be
upon him, stood when he was building the
Ka’ba.
It is one of the clear signs in the Haram, as the
Almighty says, “In it are signs manifest; (for
example) the Station of Abraham; ” (3:97).

38

39

40

Its Location:
In front of the door of the Ka’ba
10-11 m east of the Ka’ba

Its Shape:
It is square-shaped with two oval pits
in the middle bearing the footprints of
Prophet (Ibraaheem), peace be upon
him.
Its Colour:
The shades of black, yellow and white.
Its Size:
Its width, length and height are 50 cm.

41

¨ The stone is housed today in a glass
enclosure.
¨ It is also silver-coated from all sides.

42

Anyone who has performed Tawaf
around the Ka’ba is recommended,
when possible, to perform two-rak’aas
between Maqam Ibraaheem and the
Ka’ba in a place that is suitable for prayer
even if it is far away. As the Almighty says,
“And take ye the station of Abraham as
a place of prayer” (2:125)

43

However, strictly follow the instructions of security officers and
try not to harm or harass others
when performing this prayer. You
can pray anywhere behind Maqaam
Ibraaheem, far away from crowds, or
anywhere in the Grand Mosque.

44

Safa and Marwa

These are two small mountains which
Hagar, the mother of Ishmael, peace be
upon him, climbed in her search for food
or water.
Safa:
¨ A small mountain from which Sa’i
begins.
¨ The mountain rocks are still visible on
the ground floor of the Mas’aa.

45

46

Marwa:
A small mountain at which Sa’i ends.

47

Performing Sa’i between Safa and
Marwa is one of the rituals of Hajj
and Umrah.
The Almighty says, “ Behold! Safa and
Marwa are among the Symbols of
God.” (2:158)

48

The Well of Zamzam

¨ It is located east of the Ka’ba, 21
meters away from it.
¨ The circumference of the well is
3.60 m.

49

Other Names of Zamzam
¨ Suqyaa Ismaa’eel (Allah’s Gift of Water to Ishmael).
¨ Saafiyah (Pure).
¨ Mubaarakah (Blessed).
¨ Saalimah (Flawless).
¨ Taahirah (Pure).

50

¨ Caliphs and kings throughout the
ages have taken great care of the well
of Zamzam.
¨ This interest has continued to the
Saudi era.

This began with the reign of King
Abdulaziz, may Allah have mercy on
him:
¨ In 1345H (1926), he gave orders to
install drinking fountains to provide
Zamzam water for free (Sabeel).
¨ In the following year, he ordered the
construction of the second Sabeel
drinking fountains, as well the restoration of the well and the placement
of a cover over it.

51

And has continued until the reign of
King Salman, may Allah protect him:
¨ In 1439H (2018), he gave orders
to complete the Zamzam Well restoration project.
¨ He also ordered the construction
of five-service bridges to Zamzam
well from the eastern side.

52

Zamzam Watering Department:
It monitors the operations connected with
the Well of Zamzam so that water is offered
to pilgrims performing Hajj and Umrah according to the highest quality standards.

53

54
