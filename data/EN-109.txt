Madinah

Madinah was the destination the Prophetpeace be upon him migrated to, resided in and
was buried in after his death.
It is the second holiest city in Islam after Makkah.
It is also the first capital of Islam and the nucleus of Islamic civilization whose light has
spread throughout the world.


In this guide, you are going to learn about
the most important information that will
help you make the most out of your visit
to the City of Allah’s Messenger, peace be
upon him.


The Virtues and
Position of Madinah

Madinah is the second holiest site in Islam, on which Allah has conferred many
virtues including the following:


It is the Home of Islam and Guidance
Madinah was, and always will be, the home of
Islam and guidance. From it guidance emerges
and to it it will return, grow and multiply. The
Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “Faith will
retreat to Madinah just as a snake retreats to
its hole.”



The Intercession of Allah’s Messenger, Peace
Be upon Him, for Its Inhabitants
Those who live in Madinah and patiently endure hardships in it will be abundantly blessed,
for Allah’s Messenger will intercede for them
on Judgement Day. As he said: “No one from
among my people will endure the hardship and
rigour of Madinah without my being an intercessor on his behalf on the day of resurrection.”


It Is a Blessed City
The Arabic word ‘barakah’ (blessing) denotes
abundance and growth of good. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, prayed to Allah to bless its food, sustenance, and everything else in it, saying: “O God, bless us in our
fruits; bless us in our city; bless us in our sa‘;
and bless us in our mudd. O God, Abraham
was Thy servant, friend and prophet, and I am
Thy servant and prophet. He made supplication to Thee on behalf of Makkah, and I make
on behalf of Madinah the same supplication
as he made on behalf of Makkah and as much
again.”


It is a Sacred City
It is a sacred city in which the reward for good
deeds is multiplied and the sin incurred for bad
deeds is considered graver. Harming its inhabitants in any way is considered one of the major
sins in the sight of Allah.


The Names of Madinah

Madinah has many names that have
significant meanings.
Its names include:
Madinah (The City):
In Arabic, the word ‘madeenah’, or
city, is followed by the name of the
city, such as ‘The city of London’. The
prophet’s City, , is an exception as it is
self-defind.


It is described as “An-Nabawiyyah”, which
means it is the Prophet’s city.
It is further described as “Al-Munawwarah”
(the Illuminated), because of the Prophet’s
light which illuminated it with Islam and guidance following his migration to it.


Daar Al-Hijrah (The Home of Migration):
It was so named because it was honoured by
the migration of Allah’s Messenger, peace be
upon him, and his companions to it and the
safety and protection it afforded them.

Taybah (the City of Purity and Goodness):
This name is derived from the Arabic adjective
‘tayyib’, which means, among other things,
‘good, beautiful, and pure’. It is so named because of its pure soil, good inhabitants and
the agreeable, peaceful life it affords its inhabitants.


The Prophet’s
Mosque
Visiting the Prophet’s Mosque is a highly
recommended act.
Visiting it is not restricted to a particular
time, so one can visit it throughout the
year.


The Prophet, peace be upon him, said:
“A journey must not be undertaken to
visit any mosque but three: the Grand
Mosque, this mosque of mine and
Al-Aqsa Mosque.”


Some Guidelines for Visiting the Prophet’s
Mosque
¨ Enter with your right foot first
¨ Recite the supplication for entering
mosques
¨ Leave it with your left foot first
¨ Recite the supplication for leaving
mosques



¨ Perform voluntary prayers in the Honorable
Rawdhah, after obtaining permission to pray
there, taking care to avoid peak times and
crowds.
¨ Engage in supplication and remembrance
of Allah.
¨ Send your greetings to the Prophet, peace
be upon him, and his two companions, may
Allah be pleased with them, while abiding by
the prescribed Islamic rules.


¨ Making the best use of one’s time by
performing the obligatory prayers in
the Prophet’s Mosque. The Prophet,
peace be upon him, said, “Performing
one single prayer in this mosque of mine
is better than a thousand prayers performed in any other mosque, except
the Grand Mosque.”

¨

The Almighty says about this mosque,
[There is a mosque whose foundation
Was laid from the first day On piety; it is
more worthy Of thy standing forth (for
prayer) Therein. In it are men who Love
to be purified; and God Loveth those
who make themselves pure.] (9:108)

The Virtues of Quba’a:
The Prophet, peace be upon him, used to visit Quba’a Mosque and pray in it. He used to

31

Al-Qiblatayn Mosque

It is the mosque in which the change of the
qiblah took place for the first time.
When the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon
him, was in Makkah, he used to face Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) in his prayers, with the Ka’bah
in front of him, between him and Jerusalem.

32

When he migrated to Madinah, he continued facing Jerusalem in his prayers for more
than a year, albeit eager to face the Ka’ba
instead, until the Almighty granted his wish
and revealed the following verse: [We see
the turning of thy face (for guidance) to
the heavens; now shall We turn thee to a
Qiblah that shall please thee. Turn then thy
face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque;]
(2:144)
Then he started facing the Ka’ba in his
prayers.

33

Tradition has it that this happened when
the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him,
was leading Muslims during Dhuhr prayer in
the quarters of Banu Salamah. Halfway into
the prayer, he received divine revelations to
change the direction of prayer (qiblah), and
so he moved along with those behind him
to face the Ka’ba instead of Jerusalem during their prayer, hence the name ‘Masjid Al
Qiblatayn (the Mosque of the two qibla’s).

34

It is located 4 km away from the
Prophet’s Mosque, in the Banu Salamah District.

Mount Uhud

This is a majestic mountain which held a special place in the heart of our Prophet, peace
be upon him, who once said, “Uhud is a mountain which loves us and which we love.”

54

¨ One of the greatest battles of Islam took
place close to it, the Battle of Uhud in which
70 of the Prophet’s Companions were martyred, including the Master of Martyrs, Hamzah ibn ‘Abdul-Muttalib, may Allah be pleased
with him.

55

¨ The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon
him, often mentioned it when referring to
something great in size. An example of this
is his statement, in which he praised his companions, saying, “By him in whose hand my
soul is, if one of you contributed the amount
of gold equivalent to Uhud, it would not
amount to as much as the mudd of one of
them, or half of it.”
¨ It is about 4 km north of the Prophet’s
Mosque.

56

Why was it called Uhud:
Because it looks different and separate
from the mountains around it, hence the
name ‘Uhud’, which signifies uniqueness.
This mountain is situated north of Madinah,
forming a natural chain that extends from
east to west with a slight slope towards the
north.
Approximate Dimensions

2- Tour Buses

59

Mount Ar-Rumaat

(The Archers’ Mount)
This is small mountain beside Mount
Uhud.
The Story behind Its Name:
It was so named because the Prophet,
peace be upon him, ordered the archers
during the Battle of Uhud to maintain their
positions on the mountainside in order to
protect the Muslim army from the rear and
to prevent their enemies from encircling
them.

60

¨ The number of archers was fifty Companions.
¨ They were under the command of ‘Abdullaah ibn Jubayr, may Allah be pleased with
him.
¨ It was Allah’s will that some of the archers disobeyed the Prophet’s command not to leave
their positions in which he had posted them and
went down to collect their share of the booty
despite the fact that their leader pleaded with
them not to go.
¨ Khaalid ibn Al-Waleed, who was still an
idolater at the time, took advantage of the
situation by coming with the cavalry from
behind the Muslims and turning their victory into defeat, causing them to suffer heavy
casualties. The Almighty says, “What! when
a single disaster smites you although ye
smote (your enemies) with one twice as
great do ye say? “Whence is this?” Say (to
them): “It is from yourselves.’” (3:165)

61

Uhud Martyrs
Cemetery

¨ It is located to the north of the
Prophet’s Mosque.
¨ It is 5 km away from it
¨ Right at the foot of Mount Uhud

62

¨ The area of this cemetery is called
Martyrs’ Square
¨ The cemetery was so named because it contains the remains of 70
of the Prophet’s Companions who
were martyred in the Battle of Uhud.

The most famous of the Prophet’s
Companions, may Allah be pleased
with them, buried there:

¨ The Master of Martyrs, Hamza ibn ‘Abdul-

Muttalib, a paternal cousin of the Prophet,
peace be upon him.

63

¨ Today, the cemetery is surrounded by a
wall from all its sides, affording visitors
the chance to see what is inside it.

It is (Sunnah) to send greetings to those
buried in it and pray to Allah for them,
and visitors of the cemetery are recommended to do so. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, used to greet the
dead, saying, “Peace be upon you, dwellers of the abode of believers. We will
soon join you when Allah wills. May Allah have mercy on those who have gone
ahead of us and those who will come after us.”

64

The Banu Saa’idah Hall
(Saqeefat Banu Saa’idah)

¨ It is the place where the Prophet’s Companions, may Allah be pleased with
them, called a meeting after the death
of the Prophet, may peace be upon him,
and pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr asSiddeeq, may Allah be pleased with him,
to succeed the Prophet.
¨ It bears the name of the Banu Saa’idah
clan because it was on one of their farms.

65

¨ It is one of the most important historical landmarks in Madinah.
¨ It holds a significant place in the hearts
and minds of Muslims due to its historical value, which stems from the crucial
event that took place in it.
