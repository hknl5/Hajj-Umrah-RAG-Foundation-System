In this guide, you will find the most important
information, instructions, and advice related
to Muzdalifah which you need to know during
your Hajj journey.


Muzdalifah
After experiencing the great moments duringthe
Day of Arafah you will now move the third leg of
your journey of faith, which is to Muzdalifah.
Allah the Almighty said: “Then pass on at a quick
pace from the place whence it is usual for the
multitude so to do and ask for God’s forgiveness.
For God is Oft Forgiving Most Merciful.”


It was named Muzdalifah for one of two
reasons:
Because people approach (yazdalifoona) from here, meaning: they are approaching the Haram.
Because people spend nearly all of the
night (zulfan min al-layl) in it, which
means: moments and hours of the night.


Other names:
It is called “Jam’ because the people
gather there (from the Arabic root jama-’a, meaning: to gather).
It is also referred to as Al-Mash’ar AlHaraam (the Sacred Monument) because it is part of to the Haram, as mentioned in the Qur’an.


The Location of
Muzdalifah
Muzdalifah is located between Mina and
Arafat.

It has an area of 9630 m


It is all considered a valid place to
stand, as the prophet (PBUH) said:
(I have stood here, but all Jam’ is
a place for standing) Meaning:
Muzdalifah.



What do I do in
Muzdalifah?
Hajj groups differ in preparing a place for
Muzdalifah, but most of them provide
carpets, bedding and snacks, and use
public toilets.

The moment you arrive you must combine
and shorten Maghrib and ‘Ishaa, with your
group.


Make sure you rest and sleep as much as
you can during your stay in Muzdalifah in
preparation for the day of Eid.

The weather in Muzdalifah in recent
years tends to be hot, so a women should
choose a covering dress which is not too
thick.

Make sure to carry your usual medication
and to take it with you during this night.


While awake, strive to remain in
remembrance of Allah, praise Him, and
perform Talbiyah.

Feel the extent of Allah’s blessings upon
you; that He guided you, made Hajj easy
for you, made you reach Arafah, and
granted you success by enabling you to
supplicate to Him. As Allah the Almighty
said: (Celebrate the praises of God at
the Sacred Monument and celebrate
His praises as He has directed you even
though before this ye went astray.)


Al-Mash’ar
Al-Haraam Mosque

This is a mosque erected in the place where
the Messenger of Allah () stayed in
Muzdalifah during the Farewell Pilgrimage.

It is located in Muzdalifah, between
the fourth pedestrian road and King
Faisal Road.


It is located approximately in the middle
between Namirah Mosque and Al-Khayf
Mosque.
It is 5 km (3.1 miles) away from Al-Khayf
Mosque and 7 km (4.3 miles) away from
Namirah Mosque.

Eating and Street
Vendors

Some street vendors may sell food and
drinks, but you are advised not to eat
anything from them and to limit yourself
to the food and drinks which your group
provides, paying close attention to the
following:


Avoid eating any food cooked by street
vendors, and remember that keeping
cooked food at room temperature
for more than two hours leads to the
proliferation of germs and the possibility
of food poisoning.

Make sure to wash fruits and vegetables
thoroughly before eating them.

Beware of drinking very cold drinks.


Cold and Flu
Prevention

Some respiratory diseases begin to
spread during the days of Hajj, and we
advise you to prevent them by:


Avoid contact with infected people, and
avoid using the patient’s utensils and
personal items.

Pay attention to the cleanliness of your
hands, and avoid touching your eyes and
nose.

Take care to avoid crowding as much as
possible, and wear a face mask at all times.


Avoid drinking very cold water.

When you arrive at the camp, do not sit directly
in front of the air conditioners, especially when
you are sweating, as the extreme variation in
body temperature affects your health.


The Duration of the
Stay in Muzdalifah

The time for standing in Muzdalifah begins
after sunset on the day of Arafah (9 DhulHijjah).

The Madhhabs (schools of jurisprudence)
have a difference of opinion about
the amount of time one should stay in
Muzdalifah. Some say that it is sufficient
to pass through and have a short break,
while others say it is necessary to stay
until midnight, to spend two-thirds of the
night there, or until dawn.


The Messenger of Allah () remained
in Muzdalifah until Fajr prayer. Then he
supplicated to Allah, after which he went
to Mina.


The Messenger of Allah (m) also gave permission for women and those accompanying them to leave Muzdalifah before
dawn, and among them was Ibn ‘Abbaas .

The pilgrim should abide by the time set
by his group when moving from Muzdalifah, because there is room for leniency in
this matter, and the Messenger of Allah (m)
permitted those Companions who sought
permission, particularly if there are women and elderly people in their group.



Picking Up Pebbles
to Pelt the Jamarat

It is prescribed for the pilgrim to pick
up 7 pebbles before leaving Muzdalifah, which he will use to pelt Jamarat
Al-Aqaba on the day of Eid. But if he collects them in Mina or any other place,
then that is also permissible.

28

It is not preferred to pick up the pebbles
for the rest of the days from Muzdalifah,
so as not to burden the pilgrim, in addition to the fact that this is not prescribed.
Pebbles for the rest of the days should
be picked up in Mina or from anywhere
else on the way.

It is not prescribed for pilgrim to wash the
pebbles or apply perfume on them.

29

A Description
of the Pebbles Used
for Pelting

They should be small pebbles
Smaller than hazelnuts, close to the size of
peas or date pits.
Approximately 1 cm in length, more or less.

One should not use large pebbles.

30

Do not waste too much time choosing the shape of the pebbles and
their size.

After he had collected the stones in his
hand, the Prophet (m) said: “Throw
something like these.’ Then he said:
‘O people, beware of exaggeration in
religious matters for those who came
before you were doomed because of
exaggeration in religious matters.’”

31

How Do I Know My Location

in Muzdalifah?

You should stay within the location and
the camp of your own group and not leave
unless necessary.

32

33

Save your location via GPS services on
your phone such as Google Maps.

Clearly identify the most important
nearby landmark and make sure you have
someone to accompany you.

Buses, roads and stations look similar, so
make sure to stay with your group and
do not venture outside alone. know the
supervisor of your bus or group and ask
his permission or consult him if you need
anything.

34

Toilets

Toilets can be located on all sides of
Muzdalifah, and next to your place of
arrival you will find a complex of toilets
and a place to perform ablution for men,
and another for women.

35

Wait for your turn and do not skip the line by
taking the turn of someone who needs to use
the toilet facilities and arrived before you.

Make sure to leave the toilet clean for the
next person and throw your trash in the
designated places.

36

Do not harm pilgrims by littering their
path with rubbish, as this site is part of the
Haram that we have been commanded to
purify. On top of that; Muslims are required
to be clean and pure in all circumstances:
«For God loves those who turn to Him
constantly and He loves those who keep
themselves pure and clean.»
