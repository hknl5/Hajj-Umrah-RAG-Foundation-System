The Day of Arafah
The greatest pillar of Hajj, as if what preceded
it was in preparation for it and what followed
is a continuation of it. The Prophet (m) said:
“Hajj is Arafah.”

It is a venerable day, on which all pilgrims of
different colours, countries and needs stand
in one place, invoking Allah and supplicating
to Him for His mercy and forgiveness.


In this guide, you will find all the information and instructions you need about
this day and the best ways to seize those
great and irreplaceable moments.


The Day of Arafah is a day on which the
honour of time and place come together, in
moments of faith where Allah’s mercy and
kindness prevail.
It is on the ninth of Dhul-Hijjah, and the
first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah are the greatest
days of the year, as the Prophet (m) said:
“There is no virtue more to the liking of
Allah in any day than in these days, that is,
the first ten days of Dhu al-Hijjah”.

Dhul-Hijjah


Virtues
of the Day of Arafah

1

It is a day on which many people will be freed
from Hell: the Prophet (m) said: ”There is no
day when God sets free more servants from
hell than the day of Arafah.”


Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, brags about
the people of Arafah to His honorable angels, out of love and contentment with what
they do:

The Prophet (m) said: “When the day of ‘Arafa comes God descends to the lowest heaven
and praises them to the angels saying : Look at
my servants who have come to me dishevelled,
dusty and crying out from every deep valley”.



Supplication made on this day is the best
and greatest supplication: The Prophet (m)
said: “The best invocation is that of the Day
of Arafat.”


It is the most severe day for Shaytaan:
The Prophet (m) said: “Shaytaan is not
considered more abased or more cast out
or more contemptible or more angry on any
day than on the Day of Arafah. That is only
because he sees the descent of the Mercy and
Allah’s disregard for great wrong actions.”



Season of Mercy
and Gifts

Standing at Arafah is a great moment, in
which Allah draws close to His servants.
Their calls, concerns and needs are not
hidden from Him, despite their different
languages and requests.
The Companions and pious predecessors
were in two states on that day:

Some were overcome
by shyness and fear of
the Almighty in those
moments.

And some were
dominated
by
hope, thought well
of Allah, and were
confident that Allah
would answer their
supplications.

And both states are great.

Fasting on the Day
Of Arafah
The greatness, bounties and blessings of
this day reach all Muslims, even those
who did not perform Hajj. For this reason,
Allah has prescribed for non-pilgrims to
fast on the Day of Arafah so that they are
also able to receive some of the blessings.
The Prophet (m) said: “Fast the Day of
Arafah, for indeed I anticipate that Allah
will forgive (the sins) of the year after it,
and the year before it.”
As for the pilgrim, he does not fast, following
the example of the Prophet (m). He did
not fast on the day of Arafah during the
Farewell Pilgrimage to strengthen himself
for the different rituals of Hajj.


The Location
of Arafah

Arafah is a flat plain surrounded by an arc
of mountains. It is located between Makkah
and Taif, east of Makkah, and outside the
boundaries of the Haram.

When to Stand

at Arafah

The Prophet (m) stood, supplicating at
Arafah, from after the sun had passed its
zenith, until sunset and the call to prayer
for Maghrib.

It is possible to reach Arafah before this
time and leave after it, depending on
what is easy for the pilgrim, but the time
for supplication begins after the sun has
passed its zenith.

The pilgrim must stay with his group and
stick to the schedule for transportation
and movement.



How Do I Spend
My Time

While standing in Arafah, one experiences
moments of faith which are irreplaceable,
so the pilgrim must make the best use of his
time by:

Combining and shortening his Dhuhr and Asr
prayers in congregation with the people in his
group, immediately after the sun passes its
zenith, or after arrival if he arrived after the
zenith.


The pilgrim should stay in the camp and not go
out except when necessary, as the roads of Arafah
are very similar and can be difficult to navigate.

The pilgrim should make use of his time and
diversify his worship to fight fatigue and
boredom, and always remember that these are
short moments which will soon pass, while the
reward will remain.

Supplication on
the Day of Arafah

The best supplication and the one closest to
being answered is the supplication made on
the Day of Arafah, so take advantage of these
moments with supplication and recourse to
Allah.

Here are some useful ideas:


1

Record your worries and the things you
want to pray for before the day of Arafah.


Supplicate to Allah in your language and
dialect and in the way closest to your heart,
for Allah knows all secrets and that which
is hidden, and the greatest supplication is
what the heart and tongue agree on.


Pray for your parents, your family, your
brothers and your friends, and mention
them by their names, “He who supplicates
for his brother behind his back (in his absence), the Angel commissioned (for carrying supplication to his Lord) says: Amen, and
it is for you also.”


Pray to Allah for the good of this world and
the Hereafter, and do not be ashamed of
asking Allah for your worldly needs.



Supplicate to Allah by His Beautiful Names
that you know, and say: O Most Merciful (Raheem), have mercy on me, O Forgiving (Ghafoor), forgive me, and O Generous (Kareem),
be generous to me.


Repeat the same supplication many times,
for Allah loves insistency in supplication.


Supplicate with all your heart and
remember that Allah, the Exalted, is
approaching His servants at this time to
answer their supplication.

Pray to Allah with the supplications of the
Qur’an and the Prophetic supplications which
you know. You can use your notes to remind
you of them.

Namirah Mosque
A mosque built in the place where the
Messenger of Allah (m) prayed and delivered
the farewell sermon.

Dhuhr and Asr prayers as well as the sermon
on the Day of Arafah are held in it, and are
also broadcast by Islamic television and radio
stations on the Day of Arafah.

34

It is a great mosque which the Kingdom of

Saudi Arabia has taken great care in expanding
and caring for.

Until it reached an area of

110,000 m


And accomodates
more than 350,000

worshippers

(1,184,030 square foot)

It has 6 minarets on its edges with a height
of 60 metres (197 foot), which can be seen
from the various sides of Arafah.
The pilgrim should take care not to get lost or
suffer from a heat stroke by trying to pray in
Namirah Mosque. Rather, he should pray in
his camp and should not leave it except when
necessary.

35

Mount Arafat

A mountain with a small, flat-surfaced ridge
that covers a large area, made of large black
rocks.

65m
640m

The base of the mountain is 65 metres (213
foot) higher than the surrounding ground.
It has a circumference of 640 metres (700
yards).

36

On the top of the mountain there is a sign
that is 7 metres (23 foot) tall on which some
warnings are written.
The mountain is called by different names
such as.
Mount
Arafat

Mountain of
Forgiveness

Mountain
of Mercy

The Messenger of Allah (m) stood at the
bottom of the mountain and did not climb it.
When he stood there, he said: “I stood here,
but all of Arafah is a place for standing.”

37

It is not prescribed to go to the mountain or
to climb it, for our role model, the Messenger of Allah (m) never climbed it, nor did the
Companions or their followers after them.

The pilgrim must adhere to the location of
his own group in Arafah so that he does not
get lost or harm himself in the sun and heat,
and follow the words of the Messenger of
Allah (m): “I stood here, but all of Arafah is
a place for standing.”

38

39

Beware of
Heat Strokes

Pilgrims lose large amounts of fluid through
perspiration, and it is always recommended to
drink sufficient amounts of water and juice to
compensate for this.

40

Avoid going out in the sun unnecessarily.

When you go out during the day, avoid direct
exposure to the sun and use a light coloured
parasol.

Try to get enough sleep at night and avoid
staying up late, because lack of sleep exposes
the body to stress and lowers resistance.

41

Protect Yourself From
Food Poisoning

Avoid storing cooked food or eating it a long
time after buying it, especially while moving for
long periods of time.

42

Be careful when storing cooked food at room
temperature for more than two hours as this
leads to the proliferation of germs and the
possibility of food poisoning.

Make sure to wash fruits and vegetables
thoroughly before eating them.

Do not buy food from street vendors.

43

Make sure to eat an appropriate amount of
food and drink plenty of fluids such as water
and juices.

44

45

Services Provided
at Arafah

Your group usually sets up a camp for its
members which includes a resting place and
private toilets for the group.

Make sure to wear the bracelet of your group
to benefit from the services provided at the
camps.

46

Going From Arafah
to Muzdalifah in Groups
Be sure to adhere to the instructions given by the Mutawwif (Hajj guide) and follow the
times set for leaving the camp
in Arafah, so as not to be exposed to crowding and losing
your way.

Make sure you are ready when
it’s time to travel to Muzdalifah
and be sure to use the toilets
in advance, as issues may arise
that postpone your arrival to
Muzdalifah.

47

Adhere to the specified means for
transportation of your own group, whether
it is by bus or by metro.

Do not crowd, do not rush, and remain calm,
for the Messenger of Allah (m) used to hold
the reins of his camel and say: “You people
must preserve a quiet demeanour, for piety
does not consist in going quickly.”

48

Make sure to go to the toilet before you leave
the camp, because your arrival to Muzdalifah
may be delayed for any reason.

Be sure to be lenient, polite, restrain yourself,
and stay away from arguments as much as you
can, in compliance with the Words of Allah the
Almighty: ”...If anyone undertakes that duty
therein let there be no obscenity nor wickedness nor wrangling in the Hajj.”

49

50

Instructions for Using

the duration of Hajj.

It is forbidden to lie down in the stations so
as not to hurt or disrupt the flow of pilgrims.
