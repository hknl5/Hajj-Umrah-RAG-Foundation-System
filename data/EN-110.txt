What is
Ihraam?

1

It is entering into the act of worship for
Hajj or Umrah, which is done by forming
the intention to enter into Umrah or Hajj
and begins with the Talbiyah.


One has to declare the exact form of
worship that he intends at the beginning
of his Talbiyah, saying: “Labbayka
‘Umratan” or “Labbayka Hajjan”. By
saying this he enters the state of Ihraam
and starts his worship of Hajj or Umrah.



It is Sunnah to perform ghusl (bathe) or
wudhu (ablution) and enter into Ihram after an
obligatory prayer or after praying two rak’aat.


As soon as he has formed the intention, he
will have begun his rituals and must abstain
from all the prohibitions of Ihraam.


The Clothes of
Ihraam
The person in Ihraam wears a robe which is
wrapped around the lower part of his body,
and a robe which covers the top. Its colour
should be white.
He can use a buckle or belt that wraps
around his waist to hold his Izaar (the robe
covering the lower part of his body) from
falling and to keep his belongings, phone,
and money in.


All people are equal in their dress and
appearance, and are not separated by
colour or material things, and they stand
on equal footing, supplicating to Allah and
imploring Him.


Women take on the Ihraam in whatever
clothes they want, provided that they
are:

1

Loose and wide, covers everything and
does not hinder movement.


It has no adornments which are
attractive to men.


Stipulation

If the pilgrim performing Hajj or Umrah fears that
he will not be able to complete his rituals due to a
disease or a legitimate excuse or a reason outside
of his control, then it is permissible for him to stipulate the intention. He does so by saying this after
declaring his ritual when saying “Labbayka ‘Umratan” or “Labbayka Hajjan”:
“If anything prevents me, then my place is where
You prevented me.”
(he can say this in any language he prefers).

If he says this and stipulates a condition,
and then something prevents him from
completing the ritual, it is permissible
for him to leave the state of Ihraam, and
there is no atonement required from him.



Talbiyah

Talbiyah is when you say: “Labbayk-Allaahumma
labbayk, labbayka laa shareeka laka labbayk.
Innal hamda wan-ni’matah laka wal-mulk, laa
shareeka lak” (“At Your service, Allah, at Your
service. At Your service, You have no partner, at
Your service. Truly all praise, favour and sovereignty
is Yours. You have no partner.”)
And its meaning is: O Allah, we came, answering
Your call to perform Hajj or Umrah time after time,
acknowledging You in monotheism and worship,
acknowledging Your grace and the perfection of
Your supreme authority.
It is the majestic motto of the pilgrims, which
declares servitude and obedience to the Creator,
the Blessed, Glory be to Him.
Men raise their voices and women perform
talbiyah silently.


Talbiyah starts from the beginning
of Ihraam

And ends:

For the person
performing Umrah:
When they see the
Ka’ba.

For the person
performing Hajj:
When pelting
Jamarat Al-Aqaba


Miqat Dhul Hulayfah

The Miqat

In veneration of the Sacred House of Allah,
the Messenger of Allah () specified places
before Makkah from which those coming
for Hajj and Umrah must enter the state of
Ihraam. They begin reciting Talbiyah before
they reach the boundaries of the Haram.
These locations vary according to the location
one is travelling from.

The pilgrim or the visitor who lives far from
Makkah is obliged to enter the state of
Ihraam from these Miqats or a place that is
adjacent and parallel to them on their way,
whether traveling by plane or land. One
should not go beyond these points without
entering Ihraam.


Usually, planes coming to Jeddah
announce the timing of alignment with
the Miqat, so that pilgrims coming for
Hajj and Umrah can enter into the state
of Ihram.



There are three types of people when it
comes to entering the state of Ihraam:

1

Whoever is in Makkah:
Enters the state of Ihraam to perform
Umrah from the nearest place outside the
Haram, such as the mosque of the Mother
of the Believers ‘Aishah in Tan’im.
One takes on the state of Ihraam for Hajj
from his current place.


Whoever is located between Makkah and
the Miqat:
Enters into the state of Ihraam for Hajj and
Umrah from his current place.


Whoever is beyond the Miqat:
Must enter the state of Ihraam from the
Miqat or a location that is adjacent to it for
Hajj or Umrah.

Prevention of
Skin Irritation and
Inflammation of Body
Folds After Entering the
State of Ihram

The problem of skin irritation and inflammation of body folds is common among pilgrims
performing Hajj and Umrah, especially among
people with obesity or diabetes. The skin becomes infected and redness occurs in the folds
of the thighs, and sometimes in the armpits or
under the breasts, accompanied by annoying
and painful itching.


How can you prevent this?

Good ventilation of body folds such as
thighs and armpits.

Pay attention to personal hygiene and use
ointments on your body before walking.


When infected, use healing
ointments and wash the area well
before applying the medication.

Etiquette for a Person
in the State of Ihraam

From the moment the pilgrim performing Hajj and Umrah enters into the state of
Ihraam, he is involved in a great act of worship and must mind his words, actions and
behaviour and try to increase his rewards, as
the Almighty said: (For Hajj are the months
well known. If anyone undertakes that duty
therein let there be no obscenity nor wickedness nor wrangling in the Hajj. And whatever good ye do (be sure) God knoweth it.
And take a provision (with you) for the journey but the best of provisions is right conduct. So fear Me o ye that are wise!)

29

1

You have to renew your intentions and
sincerity to Allah the Exalted. The fact
that you came all the way to perform Hajj
out of love for Allah and in response to His
command, seeking His mercy and reward,
and fearing His punishment. You did not
come to show off off or out of arrogance,
nor so that people can say: “So-and-so
performed Hajj”, nor to be called a pilgrim
with the nickname “Haaj”.


Make sure to learn the rulings on Hajj and
Umrah, and ask the people of knowledge
in your group about anything that confuses
you. You will also find all the information
you need in this guide.


Ensure you have good manners with people in general and with your Hajj companions in particular. This can be by greeting
them with the salaam, smiling at them, refraining from arguments, and helping and
assisting them when they need it.

30


Tranquility and kindness when dealing
with the various situations that confront
you, as the Prophet said: (Allah is
Forbearer and He loves forbearance, and
rewards for forbearance while He does
not reward severity, and does not give
for any thing besides it (forebearance)).


Follow the instructions of the officials
and the group leaders to ensure a smooth
journey without harming or disrupting
other people.
