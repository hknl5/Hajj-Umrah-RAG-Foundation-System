The Day of
Sacrifice

The day of Eid al-Adha (the Day of Sacrifice)
is the tenth day of the month of Dhul-Hijjah.
On this day, pilgrims perform most of their
Hajj rituals.


Many scholars consider this day to be “the
greatest day of Hajj”, since standing in Arafah
and the translocation from Arafah to Muzdalifah
takes place the night before. On this day, the
rest of the great pillars of Hajj will be completed.

In this guide, you will find the most important
information, instructions, and advice you need
to know for your Hajj trip, all related to the Day
of Sacrifice.


The Deeds
Performed During
the Day of Sacrifice
Every moment of the Day of Sacrifice is
filled with great deeds:

Pelting Jamarat
Al-Aqaba

Shaving or trimming
your hair

Slaughtering your sacrificial animal for those who
are obliged to do so

Tawaf-ul-Ifaadah.

The Sa’i of Hajj


Is it Necessary
To Perform the Deeds of the
Day of Sacrifice in This Order?

Performing the deeds of the Day of
Sacrifice in advance or delaying them:
The Messenger of Allah (m) permitted
pilgrims to perform the deeds of the Day
of Sacrifice in advance or to delay them,
and to choose whatever is easiest for
them.


The Prophet (m) granted permission to
whoever came to ask him about performing
one deed before the other. In the Hadith:
When the Prophet (m) was asked about
anything as regards the ceremonies of Hajj
performed before or after its due time his
reply was, “Do it and there is no harm.”

The pilgrim has to follow the programme
of his group in arranging these actions and
their times, because that makes it easier for
him and other pilgrims and we should accept
the permission and facilitation which Allah
grants us.


Pelting Jamarat
Al-Aqaba

Jamarat Al-Aqaba is the third Jamrah for
those coming from Mina and Muzdalifah,
and it is the closest to Makkah.
It is called Jamarat Al-Aqaba and AlJamrah al-Kubra (the big Jamrah).


Jamarat Al-Aqaba

The pilgrim pelts it with seven pebbles
which he picks up from Muzdalifah or
on his way, performing Takbeer with
every pebble thrown.

When to pelt the Jamrah:
The pilgrim pelts it after coming from
Muzdalifah.
At what time does pelting begin:
The time for pelting the Jamarat begins at
midnight for those who hurry and leave
Muzdalifah at night.
At what time does pelting end:
The time for pelting
continues
throughout the day and evening of Eid.
The pilgrim, who is able to do so, should
not postpone stoning until the sun rises
on the eleventh day.


The pilgrim must abide by the time
specified for pelting by his group, so as
not to harm himself and other pilgrims
by crowding them at their allotted time.

You may encounter crowds or pushing
while on the move, so remain calm
and courteous with the other guests
of Allah.


Performing
Takbeer
When the pilgrim pelts Jamarat Al-Aqaba,
the time for Talbiyah ends, and so he should
start performing Takbeer all day and after the
obligatory prayers, in glorification of Allah,
in remembrance of Him, and in praise of Him
for facilitating Hajj for him. He should say:
Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha il-Allaah,
wallaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, wa lillaahil hamd.
(Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest. There is
no deity besides Allah and Allah is the greatest. Allah
is the greatest and all praises are for Allah only).
Or he can say:
Allaahu akbar kabeeran, wal-hamdu lillaahi
katheeran, wa subhaan Allaahi bukratan wa aseelan
(Allah is the Greatest, Most Great. Praise is to
Allah, abundantly. Glory is to Allah, at the break of
day and at its end).


Slaughtering
The Sacrificial Animal

It is prescribed for the pilgrim on this great
day to sacrifice his sacrificicial animal if
he is obliged to do so.
The sacrifice is the animal which the
pilgrim sacrifices in order to draw closer
to Allah during his pilgrimage in Mina or
Makkah (within the boundaries of the
Haram), after which he eats from it or
donates to charity.


The wisdom behind the sacrifice:
1. Drawing closer to Allah, and showing
love for Him, glory be to Him.
2. Granting relief and giving charity to the
poor and the needy.
3. The veneration of Makkah and the
Sacred House of Allah.


Who Is Obliged
to Sacrifice?

The sacrifice is obligatory for two types of
pilgrims:
1. The pilgrim performing Tamattu’: He
is the one who performs Umrah on
his journey, then leaves the state of
Ihram, and then enters into the state
of Ihram again for Hajj.
2. The pilgrim performing Qiraan: He
is the one who combines Umrah and
Hajj in his rituals.

It is not obligatory for a pilgrim performing
Ifraad, who has taken on the state of Ihram
for Hajj only.


The sacrifice should be from the cattle
of livestock:
Camels, cows, sheep, or goats.


Appointing Someone
Else to Slaughter in Your Place

With the large number of pilgrims today
from all over the world, pilgrims usually
delegate and appoint the competent
authorities to slaughter on their behalf.

If the pilgrim had previously assigned
someone to sacrifice on his behalf
through one of the available methods,
then he has performed the sacrifice on
the Day of Sacrifice.


This can be done by purchasing physical or
electronic vouchers from pilgrim stations,
through electronic services, or through your
own Hajj group.

This is easier for the pilgrim and makes sure
the meat is delivered to those who need it.

Beware of dealing with unlicensed
individuals or entities when appointing
someone else to sacrifice on your
behalf, so that you do not become a
victim of fraud.

Shaving and
Trimming

After pelting Jamarat Al-Aqaba, it is prescribed for the pilgrim to shave or trim
his hair
Women should bundle their hair and cut
about 2 cm / 0.8 inch from it.
All of this is done in an attempt to draw
nearer to Allah and glorify Him.


The pilgrim worships Allah, and
submits to His command. It is
forbidden in Ihram to cut his hair
and he complies, then he is ordered
to shave or trim it and he obeys.


Designated
Shaving and
Trimming Areas

There are places equipped for
haircuts with a large number of
approved barber stalls. The pilgrim
finds these after pelting Jamarat AlAqaba.


Health Advice

Choose a licensed barber in a designated
place. Stay away from road and sidewalk
barbers, and do not expose yourself to
infectious diseases.


When at the barber, make sure:

¨ He

uses razors with
plastic handles, which are
disposable.

¨ He changed the shaving
tools after the previous
pilgrim, and brought out
new ones.

¨ He washed his hands with
soap and water before he
started shaving.


Leaving the
State of Ihram

After shaving or trimming, the pilgrim
will have completed the first dissolution
(partial dissolution) of his Ihram. By
doing this, it becomes permissible
for him to do everything which was
forbidden to him because of Ihram,
except for intercourse.

28

After pelting and shaving, it is
prescribed for him to take a bath,
apply perfume, and put on his clothes
for the day of Eid.

29

If after that he performs Tawaf alifaadah, he has completely dissolved
his Ihram, and he is permitted to do
what remained of the prohibitions of
Ihram.

30

Beware of forgetting and losing your
personal belongings when showering
and using toilets on the day of Eid,
and be sure to take your belongings
or store them in a safe place.

31

Important Warnings
Before Arriving at the
Grand Mosque

The pilgrim should not perform Tawaf
unless he has fully coordinated with
his own group about the specified
time assigned to the group, and with
clear knowledge of the location of his
camp in Mina.

32

Attention: Almashaer Metro Line does
not go to the Grand Mosque, but there
are buses provided by some groups to
travel to the Grand Mosque.

Memorize the bus stops and assembly
points after completing your Umrah.

33

When you arrive at the squares around
the Grand Mosque, you will find panels in
front of the gates, that show those coming from afar whether the gate is suitable
for entry or exit.

34

Not only the ground floor but all
floors of the Grand Mosque are
prepared for Tawaf during this day,
and the following days.

35

Escalators

You will usually need to use the
escalators to go up or down in the
Grand Mosque and reach its squares
and services, so here are the most
important warnings when using
them:

36

1
Do not sit on the escalator, even if you are
tired.


Stand firmly on the escalator and hold on to
the moving belt.


Women should be careful that their hijabs
and jilbabs do not get stuck at the end of the
escalator.


Walk immediately after the escalator
reaches the end so that people do not
collide into you from behind.

37

Do not take wheelchairs onto the escalator,
unless you do so with the help of a competent
person.


If you have an elderly person or a person who
is not accustomed to taking the escalator,
be by his side and hold him to protect him
from falling.

Do not push people or harm pilgrims if there
is crowding while going up or down, and give
your brothers an opportunity to get on.


Do not place your foot on the side brush
at the bottom of the escalator, as this may
injure you and disrupt the cleaning system
of the escalator.

38

Tawaf-ul-ifaadah

This is one of the most important pillars
of Hajj and is also called Tawaf Az-Ziyaarah or Tawaf Al-Hajj.
One should circumambulate the Ka’ba
seven times. Allah almighty said:“Then let
them complete The rites prescribed For
them, perform their vows, And (again)
circumambulate The Ancient House.”

39

The time for Tawaf-ul-Ifaadah:
The time for Tawaf-ul-Ifaadah begins at
midnight on the day of Eid on the tenth
of Dhul-Hijjah, for those who did not
remain in Muzdalifah.
The time for Tawaf-ul-Ifaadah ends with
the end of the month of Dhul-Hijjah,
but the pilgrim should initiate Tawaf-ulIfaadah at the time set for his group on
the day of Eid or the days following it.

40

Performing Tawaf in a wheelchair:
Electric and manual wheelchairs are available in the Grand Mosque and they can be
obtained from a number of locations inside
the Grand Mosque.

The Sa’i of Hajj

The Sa’i of Hajj consists of seven circuits
between Safa and Marwa.
Starting from Safa and going to Marwa. If
he reaches Marwa, he has completed one
circuit, and if he returns to Safa, he has
completed the second circuit, and so on,
until the seventh circuit ends at Marwa.

42

It is prescribed for the pilgrim to
supplicate at the beginning of each
circuit, facing the Qiblah in a place
that does not obstruct the passage of
others.

43

Who Is Required to Perform Sa’i
After Tawaf-ul-Ifaadah?

The pilgrim must perform one Sa’i during
his Hajj, but there are several different
situations for pilgrims when it comes to the
Sa’i of Hajj:

44

1

The one performing Tamattu’, who
performed ‘Umrah at his arrival, then
left the state of Ihram and then reentered Ihram for Hajj. He is obliged to
perform Sa’i after performing Tawaful-Ifaadah, because his first Sa’i was for
Umrah.


The person performing Qiraan who combines Hajj and Umrah, and the person peforming Ifraad who entered the state of
Ihram for Hajj only. For these two, there
are two possible situations:
¨ If they made Tawaf when they first
came to Makkah and then made
Sa’i, then that is the Sa’i of Hajj,
and they do not have to perform
another Sa’i.
¨ If they did not perform Sa’i before, then they must perform Sa’i
after Tawaf-ul-Ifaadah.

45

Warnings to those
Coming to the Grand Mosque

The Grand Mosque is one of the greatest
places which you will visit in your life, but
its gates and minarets are numerous and
all look similar to those who do not know
them. So as to not get lost, here are some
important tips:

46

1

Clearly know the outside assembly point
and write its name down for yourself (to
ask about it if needed).


Save the assembly point on your mobile
phone via a GPS service such as Google
Maps.


Find out the gate number from which
you entered the Grand Mosque.

47


Stay with the group that you came to
perform Tawaf with, or at least some of
them.


Store the number of the group supervisor
and some of your companions to call them
when needed or if you are lost, God forbid.


If you encounter a big crowd or a stampede,
keep calm and earn more rewards with
patience, a smile, and kindness to other
pilgrims.

48


Do not hesitate to ask security guards for
help if needed.

So be careful not to defile the purity and
cleanliness of this place by:

¨ Throwing leftovers
