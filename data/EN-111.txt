Mina’s Status
A small valley which contains all of the sacred sites and memories of pilgrims, not
only today, but from the ancient history of
mankind, many prophets prayed and stayed
here.
It still embraces pilgrims at the beginning of
their journey, from the eighth of Dhul-Hijjah
until the completion of Hajj, covering the
Day of Sacrifice and the Days of Tashreeq.
This is an interactive guide to learn more
about this great sacred site.


The Boundaries of Mina
and Information About It

It is a valley within the boundaries of
the Haram, extending from east to west,
surrounded by mountains from the north
and south, and bounded by Wadi Muhassir
in the east to the Big Jamrah.


3.2

The length of the site is about 3.2 km
(2 miles).

7.82

The area of Mina according to Islamic
law is estimated at 7.82 km (3.02
square miles).


Approximately 61% of the area of Mina is
used by pilgrims. The other 39% consists
of mountainous terrain which is difficult to
inhabit. Some of the mountain peaks rise
500m (1640 ft) above the surface of the
valley.


If Mina becomes too narrow for thepilgrims, there is room for leniency and it
is possible to stay in the areas next to it
within the boundaries of the Haram.


Why Is It
Named Mina?

It is possible that Mina was named by this
name for one of two following reasons:

Firstly, it may be due to the sacrifices made
to become closer to Allah after completing
the rituals; ‘mina’ means ‘sacrifice’.
Secondly, it is said that our father Adam
(PBUH) was in Mina, and Jibreel (Gabriel)
said to him upon leaving: “Make a wish
(tamanna)!” He said “I wish (atamanna)
for Paradise”, so it was called Mina from
At-Tamanni” (requesting a wish)


Mina on the Eighth
Day (At-Tarwiyah)

Most pilgrims stay in Mina on the
eighth of Dhul-Hijjah, during which
they pray Dhuhr in a state of Ihraam.
Pilgrims remain there until Fajr on the
ninth of Dhul-Hijjah.


This day was called Yawm At-Tarwiyah
(the Day of Irrigation). The name
originates from the ancient tradition of
people having to carry water with them
in preparation for the Day of Arafah, and
praise be to Allah for His facilitation and
grace these days.


Reaching
Mina

When you arrive in Mina, be sure to take
all your luggage from the bus which you
were on.

Find out about the services available for
you at the camp.



Find out the camp’s location, its number,
nearest landmarks, and metro station
number (if your group uses the metro),
and ensure you have proof of this.

Record the camp’s geographical location
using the GPS service on your mobile
phone.

Warning: All of the roads and camps are
very similar in Mina.


Know who your group supervisor is
so as to refer to them when needed to
answer your questions.

Do not leave the camp unless necessary, and only after obtaining permission from your group supervisor.

Make sure to frequently perform
Talbiyah recite the Qur’an and
remember Allah. Supplicate to Allah to
make Hajj easier for you and that He
may accept it from you.

Pilgrims shorten their prayers in
congregation (jamaa’ah) in their
camps.

Make sure to rest and sleep well before
the Day of Arafah.



The Days of
Tashreeq

The days of Tashreeq are the three days
after Eid-ul-Adha: 11th, 12th, and 13th of
Dhul-Hijjah, which are days of Eid and joy
following the completion of Hajj.

The Prophet (m) said about these days:
“The days of Tashreeq are days of eating,
drinking and remembering Allah.”


The name ‘Tashreeq’ originates from the
practice of slaughtering the sacrifice on the
day of Eid, where people would would cut
the meat and expose it under the sun, so
that it would dry and not spoil. This method of food preparation is called ‘Tashreeq’.


Takbeer During
The Days of Tashreeq

It is Sunnah for the pilgrim to perform takbeer
and to repeat it during the days of Tashreeq at
all times, especially after the obligatory prayers.
He should say
Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha il-Allaah.
Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, wa lillaahil-hamd.
Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest. There
is no deity besides Allah and Allah is the greatest.
Allah is the greatest and all praises are for Allah
only.
Allaahu akbar kabeeran, wal-hamdu lillaahi
katheeran, wa subhaan Allaahi bukratan wa
aseelan.
Allah is the Greatest, Most Great.
Praise is to Allah, abundantly, glory is to Allah, at
the break of day and at its end.



Pelting
the Jamarat

The greatest deed a pilgrim can enact
during the days of Tashreeq is pelting the
Jamarat.
The pilgrim must:
Pick up 21 pebbles per day to pelt the
three Jamarat; pelting each one with
seven pebbles.


The pilgrim should go to the Jamarat
according to the time allotted to his group

The pilgrim is bound by the arranged
means of transportation, whether it is
by metro, bus, or walking.


The small Jamrah

When the pilgrim reaches the small Jamrah,
which is the first one he will meet, he should
throw seven pebbles at it, performing takbeer
with each throw.
Thereafter,
he should
move away from the
Jamrah, away from the
crowds, and withdraw from
the road so as not to block
the path of the pilgrims. He
should then turn towards
the Qiblah, raise his hands
in supplication and pray for
whatever he wants: mercy,
forgiveness, reconciliation,
and acceptance of his Hajj.

28

The middle Jamrah

Once this is done, he should move on to
the middle Jamrah (which is the second
Jamrah), and do what he did at the first
Jamrah.

29

Jamarat Al-Aqaba

Finally, he should set out for Jamarat AlAqaba (the big Jamrah), which is the third and
final Jamrah, and he should pelt it as he did
with the one before it, with seven pebbles.
But it is not prescribed for him to supplicate
after pelting this Jamrah.
The pilgrims should not remain in their
spot once they have finished pelting the
Jamarat, so as not to disrupt the pilgrims’
movement and departure.

How Do I Get to
the Jamarat?

Ways to reach the Jamaraat vary according
to the group, and its time and location. The
pilgrim must adhere to the method used by
his group.

1) Almashaaer metro line: Many pilgrims
arrive at the Jamarat via Almashaaer metro
line. After this, pilgrims still have a great
distance to travel on foot to reach the
Jamarat.

31

2) Pedestrians: Those who reach the Jamarat
on foot. It is advisable to carry a sunshade
to protect them from direct sunlight if they
will be pelting during the day. Pilgrims should
ensure they wear comfortable shoes which
are suitable for walking long distances.

3) Buses: Other pilgrims may choose to
arrive at the Jamarat by buses which are
suited for larger groups.

32

33

Golf carts are available to transport the
elderly and those who are not able to walk
when ascending the Jamarat Bridge.

Be sure to take your medicines, such as
allergy and asthma inhalers, as you may need
them due to fatigue, long walking, and dust
inhalation.

34

Strictly adhere to the directives of the security
men and follow the rules as they are in place for
the benefit, safety, and comfort of the pilgrims.
Be sure not to disobey these directives as this
will lead to overcrowding, bottlenecks, and will
cause harm to the guests of Allah.

There are emergency teams scattered all
over the Jamarat, and you can call them in
case you experience any health issues, Allah
forbid.

After you have finished pelting Jamarat AlAqaba you will find many services, such as
toilets, barbers, and restaurants.

Hastening
and Delaying

It is permissible for a pilgrim to
hasten his Hajj and leave Mina on
the 12th, or delay and leave on the
13th of Dhul-Hijjah, as the Almighty
said: (If anyone hastens to leave in
two days there is no blame on him
and if anyone stays on there is no
blame on him).

37

Hastening or delaying will be according
to the programme of the group which
the pilgrim is a part of.

If he is hastening, he should pelt the
Jamarat on the 11th of Dhul-Hijjah and
then on the 12th only, and it is not
prescribed for him to perform a second
pelting on the 12th instead of the 13th,
which he will not spend in Mina.

38

The pilgrim must adhere strictly to the
movement times set by the Hajj group he
is a part of.

39

Leaving Mina

Strictly adhere to the appointments
and directions of the group’s supervisor
concerning the time and manner of
departure and the time of Tawaf AlWada’ (Farewell Tawaf), so as not to
expose yourself to inconveniences.

40

Gather your luggage well in advance
of departure.

Write down the time and place
specified by your group’s supervisor
for assembling, when going to, and
returning from the Grand Mosque.
Write this information down on a piece
of paper or store it on your mobile
phone.

41

Make sure the battery of your mobile
phone is fully charged when you leave.

Make sure to accompany some of the
pilgrims of your group on your way there
and back, and avoid remaining alone.

42

Tawaf Al-Wada’
(Farewell Tawaf)

Tawaf Al-Wada’ (Farewell Tawaf) is a Tawaf
that the pilgrim performs after leaving Mina
and before leaving Makkah, in compliance
with the command of the Prophet (m)
for pilgrims to make Tawaf their last
engagement with the Ka’ba.

There is an exception for those with a
legitimate excuse, such as menstruation
or postpartum bleeding; in such cases the
farewell Tawaf is not prescribed for them.

43

If the pilgrim delays Tawaf al-Ifaadah (the Tawaf
of Hajj) until the time of his departure from
Makkah, his Tawaf al-Ifaadah suffices him
for Tawaf Al-Wada’ and he does not need to
perform Tawaf again.

location, and gate, and carry with you evidence
of it: a bracelet or a piece of paper.

Health Tips
in Mina

Always wash or sanitize your hands,
especially before and after eating, after
using the bathroom, after sneezing or
coughing, and when returning to your
place of residence.

52

Stay away from cold air streams,
especially after physical exertion, or after
arriving at the camp from outside.

One should always try to wear face masks,
especially in crowded places.

53

Be sure to get rid of waste and rubbish by
putting it in the designated places. See it
as your contribution towards keeping the
House of Allah and the Haram clean.

Always maintain your personal hygiene,
as well as the cleanliness of your clothes,
mouth, and teeth, in order to protect
yourself from many diseases and germs,
God willing.

54

Exposure to the Sun

Pilgrims lose large amounts of fluid
through sweating, so it is always
recommended to remain hydrated
through drinking sufficient amounts of
water and juice to compensate for this.

55

Avoid going out in the heat of the sun if
it is not necessary.

If going out during the day, do your best
to avoid direct exposure to the sun, and
use a light-colored parasol for further
protection.

56

Get as much sleep at night as possible
and avoid staying up late, because lack
of sleep exposes the body to stress and
weakens its immunity.

57

Steps to Prevent
Food Poisoning

Avoid storing cooked food, or eating
it long after it has been distributed,
especially after travelling for long periods
of time between the different sites.

58

Make sure to properly wash fruits and
vegetables before eating them.

Avoid buying food from street vendors.

59

Colds and
Respiratory Diseases

Respiratory diseases are among the most
common Hajj diseases, and are caused
by the transmission of germs or viruses
through coughing or sneezing.

people.

Do not use utensils used by
others.

Wash hands
regularly.

Avoid big crowds.
